This project is part of **APP IDEAS** repository, and it's a book finder called **Book lover**.

To develop this web app/site I used:
* Node.js
* Google Books API.

*Probabily many projects from the APP IDEAS repository will be brought here, I hope so.*

In order to run the project locally, you need to:
* [**Install Node.js**, *which includes NPM*.](https://nodejs.org/en/ "Nodejs web site")
* Download or clone the project to your computer
* Run the below code on command line inside the downloaded/cloned project:
````
    npm install
````
* After all the instaltion is finished run the code:
````
    nodemon app
````
* Finally, on your browser go to:
````
    localhost:3000
````
