This project is part of APP IDEAS repository, and it's a book finder.
To develop this web app/site I used Node.js and de Google Books API.
Probabily many projects from the APP IDEAS repository will be brought here, I hope so.

In order to run the project locally, you need to install Node.js, which includes NPM.

After installing Node.js, download the project, and run the command "npm install" in the command line inside the project directory
